            <p class="description">
                The chunk of sirloin I bought and had thinly sliced by the butcher at Seafood City
                a few days ago was pretty huge and, at roughly four pounds, was more than enough
                for one meal. I used about one pound for the beef and baby corn stir-fry we had
                for lunch yesterday and turned the remaining meat into beef tapa to
                enjoy for breakfast this weekend.

                <h2>Steps</h2>
                <div class="instructions">
                    <div class="item">
                        <div class="num">1.</div>
                        <p>The first thing to do is marinate the pork belly in soy sauce and crushed garlic.
                            It is best to marinate it overnight. If time is limited, one hour should be enough.
                            Some like to add vinegar during the process. You may do so if preferred.</p>
                        </div>
                <div class="item">
                    <div class="num">2.</div>
                        <p>Drain the marinade. Save it for later. The marinated pork needs to be browned.
                            Heat a cooking pot. Add pork with garlic. You can also add a few tablespoons
                            of cooking oil. Cook the pork until it turns brown.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="item">
                        <div class="num">3.</div>
                            <p> 
                                Cook the pork until tender. Do this by pouring the remaining marinade,
                                if any. Also add water. Let the liquid boil. This is the part where I
                                put the whole peppercorn and dried bay leaves. These ingredients complete
                                my pork adobo. Boiling for 40 minutes should be enough to tenderize the pork.
                                There are times when you have to cook longer.
                            </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="item">
                        <div class="num">4.</div>
                            <p> 
                                If you have not added the vinegar as part of the marinade, pour it
                                into the pot and let it cook for 10 minutes. Salt is an optional
                                ingredient for this recipe. Use it only if you think it is needed.
                            </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="item">
                        <div class="num">5.</div>
                            <p> 
                                Taste the sauce first so that you know what seasonings to add. Since we
                                already added a good amount of soy sauce, salt might not be needed. However,
                                this depends on your preference. You can also add more water here if you think
                                that then saltiness is on the upper side. Sometimes I also add a dash of sugar
                                to balance the flavor.
